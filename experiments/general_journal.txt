    having another go at this
    focus on contrasts that compare one experiment against the other
    and the increasing vs. steady reward

    think about a better analysis paradigm for exploratory data analysis...

    okay so the increasing reward effect came through
        great news
        
    i think another possible hook for foraging is that (i believe) this was the
    first version we ran online
        pretty sure about that
        so contrasting the effects against things we reported in b&a2018 would
        be good

    dont forget i can prob borrow large amounts of text from the failed write up
    of the first couple submissions of the disconnect stuff

    going back to b&a2018 and finding a lot here
        the whole current v other thing i totally forgot about
        we have an analysis of how the indifference point changed over time
        as well as the ggpairs including some reward sensitivity metric we
        calculated

        i think it's a good idea to stick closely to this ^ precedant, add in
        the f&d effect, make the case that disconnect is an ideal way to study
        how ppl respond to a variety of changes in reward that are outside their
        control.

        sell individual differences as a plus, could explore strategy selection

	trying this again
	for some reason i just have publication fever
	i wanna get something out of these data that can be typed up
	
	keep probing the descriptives for difference = 1 & difference = 2
	simplify things, look at basic stuff
	think just get together a general catalog of behvaior
	a few metrics that can divide subjects into different groups
	portray disconnect as a complement to foraging
		highlight different strengths of the two paradigms

	disconnect
		look at choices across sudden increasing reward vs steadily high reward
		the frober dreisbach stuff
